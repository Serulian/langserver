The Serulian Language Server provides IDE support for development of [Serulian](https://github.com/Serulian/spec) web/mobile applications in any IDE that supports the [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/).

For more information about the Language Server Protocol or tools that support it, please look at the repository referenced above or the [Visual Studio Code Blog Post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/06/27/common-language-protocol).

## Project Status
